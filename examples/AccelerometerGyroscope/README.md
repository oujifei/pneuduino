## 08 I2C Accelerometer and Gyroscope
**Boards:** Master, valve board, and Grove extension board</br>
**Tube connections:** Same as previous example

The Grove 6-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope is another sensor that can be used to allow physical input to control inflatables. This example shows how to use the sensor and its corresponding library to respond to motion. In this example, the gyroscope readings are used to detect shaking. When a strong motion is detected, the valve is turned on for a moment. Gently tapping the sensor will send a brief pulse of air to the inflatable, and vigorously shaking the sensor will hold the valve open.
