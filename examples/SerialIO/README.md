## Serial IO with Computer
**Boards:** Master and valve board</br>
**Tube connections:** Same as previous example

Pneuduino can use serial communication to send and receive information with a computer. This functionality is identical to that of Arduino and can be referenced [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/). Serial communication opens up the the possibility to use an entire computer as a sensor device to control Pneuduino.

Run the code on Pneuduino, and open the Arduino serial console. This simple example first prints lines of text, giving usage instructions. Use the `inflate` and `deflate` commands to control Pneuduino&#39;s valves.
